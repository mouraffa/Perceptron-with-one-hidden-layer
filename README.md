# Perceptron with One Hidden Layer and Softmax Function
This project is an implementation of a Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function. The purpose of this project is to build a neural network that can classify input data into different categories.

# Steps
The project is divided into several steps:

 - Architecture : We design the architecture of the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function. This includes defining the number of input and    output nodes, the number of hidden nodes, and the activation functions to be used.

 - Learning rule: We define the learning rule for the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function. This includes the cost function to be used,    as well as the gradient descent algorithm.

 - Pseudo-code: We write pseudo-code for the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function.

 - Implementation using Python and NumPy: We implement the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function using Python and the NumPy library. We      provide detailed explanations of the code and the mathematical equations involved.

 - Application to iris123.siam2 dataset: We apply the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function to the iris123.siam2 dataset. We explain the    dataset and the results obtained.

 - Implementation using C++: We implement the Perceptron with one hidden layer and softmax function using C++. We provide detailed explanations of the      code and the mathematical equations involved.
